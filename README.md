# wizard101-trivia-solver
The goal of this tool is to automate the trivia solving process to make it fast and easy to earn 100 crowns per day. I am still developing this tool.

This project is not fully finished, and it needs help. I am looking for help in order to complete the `trivia.json` databse. PRs are welcome. 

Developed using Python 3.7. Tested with Python 3.0+.
